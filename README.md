#About the Project

This is a portfolio JavaScript Project in Codecademyâ€™s Full Stack Engineer Path.
This project required us to generate random message whenever it is run by the user.

##Process

1. Created 3 variables that will contain each part of the random sentence
2. Created the function that will loop throught all 3 arrays.
3. Used Math.random() in each to get a random index from the array.
4. Return a new random sentence.

You may find this reasoning very old fashion; but I am proud of it ðŸ˜…. So, feel free to comment if is there a more efficient way to get this resutl?
